       <p><u><font size="5">How long have you been streaming for? </font></u></p>
                 <p><font size="4">Roughly about 4 months, I think.</font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What got you into streaming? </font></u></p>   
                  <p><font size="4">Honestly, it’s really hard to say exactly. Between work and family I never really get the chance to hang out with people. This is kind of a way to do that. </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
        <p><u><font size="5">What do you normally play/do on your channel? </font></u></p>   
                  <p><font size="4">I typically play, more or less, whatever game I’m interested in at the moment. I’ve mostly played rogue- and souls-like games.</font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What got you into gaming? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">It was actually my brother and step-dad that got me into games. I remember sitting in the dining room as a kid, that was where we had a small tv my step-dad would use, watching him play Lufia and Zelda. Sometimes we’d play Bomberman as a family though. That was loads of fun. </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What was the first game you played? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">The first game I ever played… that’s actually a really hard one to say. Other than family game nights I think the first game I played was Pokemon Red when it released when I was 8. Other than that though, it’d have to be Star Wars Episode 1: Racer with my older brother on his N64. </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What is your all time favorite game? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">My all time favorite game.. That is also a really hard one to answer. My interests change frequently. Some games I played and loved before pretty much bore me now. One I can always remember playing though is Final Fantasy VII. That was actually the first RPG I ever finished. I still go back to it every now and then, but I never finish it anymore. Other than that though, I keep going back to the Souls series. I can tell you for sure though, I will be taking time off Souls when that FF7 Remake releases in March.</font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What do you do for fun off stream? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">I’ve actually been forcing myself to get back into writing so I can maybe finish my book in the next year. Lol. Other than that, I mostly spend time with my wife (Wweh) and my son, Derrik. Gotta say though, I love watching Sword Art Online!</font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">How did you get your Twitch name? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">My Twitch name is actually a name I’ve used in games as far back as I can remember. I don’t remember how it came to me, but I’ve been using it for years! In games, stories, and as a general username.</font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What brought you to the community? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">It was actually one of my best friends that recommended I join the Crew: x1seriousmoose. He’s also the first one, other than my wife, to really support and encourage me to start streaming. </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What's your favorite thing about Twitch Crew? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">How welcoming and engaging everyone is! I’m typically a shy person but it’s so easy to talk to everyone in the crew! It really helps so much!</font></p>
