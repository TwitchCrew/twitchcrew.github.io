       <p><u><font size="5">How long have you been streaming for? </font></u></p>
                 <p><font size="4"> It will be two years in December!  </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What got you into streaming? </font></u></p>   
                  <p><font size="4">Honestly, I had not a clue when I first got started so was basically just streaming so my friends could watch.  </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
        <p><u><font size="5">What do you normally play/do on your channel? </font></u></p>   
                  <p><font size="4"> Mostly shooter and BR games, but I'm currently revisiting my variety roots and doing some IRL and music stuff as well!  </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What got you into gaming? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">My father built me my first gaming PC when I was 7 years old. It had windows 98 and 256mb of RAM hha. After he passed I carried on the legacy. Runs in the family! </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What was the first game you played? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">It was a game called carnivores I believe. A dinosaur hunting game. Looking back, the graphics were so miserable haha. </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What is your all time favorite game? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">Runescape is a game that really helped me get more immersed into both gaming, and Twitch. So I think in a nostalgic way it takes the cake.   </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What do you do for fun off stream? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">Off stream I'm a music producer and songwriter, I do that whenever I'm not off of the stream. As of recently I've been doing a lot of music for TV & Film. </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">How did you get your Twitch name? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">I just underwent a rebrand from "dukelimond" to "lukedimond". I got the first name by switching my first and last name's first letters back in the AIM days. But just decided to switch to my full and legal name due to branding decisions and keeping it simple!</font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What brought you to the community? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4"> Noodles came to me with a vision one day and brought me on in the beginning originally as an admin and behind the scenes business guy. So I got to see his vision blossom from the beginning, which was rad! </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What's your favorite thing about Twitch Crew? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4"> Unity and the fact that when the meetups happen, it doesn't feel like a networking event and more of a family gathering. Networking is cool and all, but TC is much much bigger than that.</font></p>
