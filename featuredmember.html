       <p><u><font size="5">How long have you been streaming for? </font></u></p>
                 <p><font size="4">Started sometime in 2016 just using the PS4's built in features. Started taking it seriously around 2018 because it genuinely makes me happy to interact with people. </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What got you into streaming? </font></u></p>   
                  <p><font size="4">I have always wanted to do a podcast, write a blog, and/or curate a decent YouTube channel. Over the years I have tried each of them at different times with nothing really taking hold of my desire to create content. Streaming kind of felt like combination of all those different media so I jumped in. Ever since... I've been having a blast every time I turn on OBS. </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
        <p><u><font size="5">What do you normally play/do on your channel? </font></u></p>   
                  <p><font size="4">Normally, I'm playing some sort of single player game and chatting as much as possible (even if it's to myself). Once in a while I'll pull in the squad and we'll roam around together as well. When I'm not doing a gaming stream I love doing talk shows. </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What got you into gaming? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">My first memory of gaming is on an old Mac computer with 5" floppy disks. It was some sort of space investigation game that I can't remember the name of. Over the years I have done PC gaming, NES ...[giant list skipped]..., and now primarily PS4. Gaming has always been a part of my life ever since that first 5" floppy and it's really the only hobby that has stuck with me through "growing up."</font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What was the first game you played? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">Ah ha! Already answered in the last question! Have a suspicious feeing that wasn't my very first game though. It's just the first game that I can remember playing because it was on a computer in my room.</font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What is your all time favorite game? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">This is a hard one... I want to say Horizon Zero Dawn or Spiderman (the new one)... but when I think of it I have to say Goldeneye 007 on N64. No other game has created the amount of memories that it has.</font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What do you do for fun off stream? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">During the non-cold months I love playing Disc Golf, paintball, board games, and generally just hanging with friends and family. I also do the dad thing so watching my kids play soccer is one of my frequent and awesome activities too. </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">How did you get your Twitch name? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">Well... at first I was "Darth_T0XICATED" which came from an old GPrime video "The Sith Rejects" (still available on YT). After a run of having to spell that name every... single... time... because of the “O” being a zero... I decided that I need something that is easier to spell and remember. I'm a huuuuuge Darth Vader and Star Wars fan so I wanted to keep "Darth" in my name. After trying a few "meh" names I settled on "TheRealDarthGuy" because well... in my little world it sounds cool and all the words are nice and simple to spell!</font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What brought you to the community? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">The member that brought me was SplyceSpeaks. I forget how I stumbled upon his show but he quickly brought me in the TC and I immediately felt the difference in this Discord family vs others I was a part of.</font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What's your favorite thing about Twitch Crew? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">The way that the members support each other. The support that is shown throughout the day in Discord and in stream chats is completely amazing and makes you really feel like you are part of something much larger. It makes the feeling of a small streamer out on an island alone subside.</font></p>
