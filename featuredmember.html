       <p><u><font size="5">How long have you been streaming for? </font></u></p>
                 <p><font size="4">  About 5 months now, since I started taking it seriously… 
    I streamed before under a different name but without any direction (or many followers haha) </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What got you into streaming? </font></u></p>   
                  <p><font size="4">As a long time gamer, and person who loves to entertain a crowd.. it seemed like the right place for me to be.  With a growing family and everything else in life, I don’t have as much of a chance to get out and play music with my band and stuff like that… So it’s a nice little escape to be able to entertain from the comfort of my home!  </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
        <p><u><font size="5">What do you normally play/do on your channel? </font></u></p>   
                  <p><font size="4"> I do all kinds of things!!! Mondays I do Mario Maker 2 content, Thursday are my throwback day, which I’m currently playing the original Metal Gear Solid, I sometimes stream live acoustic performances that I play at local venues, I’ve done drumming to song request streams and also some acoustic performances from my streaming room,  Sunday nights I have been doing a completely blinded run of Final Fantasy VII (where I play the game without looking at it, at the mercy of the #BASS community discord’s voice chat), and I do a morning stream every day before work, where I’ve been playing some Retro Zelda Gameboy games!!! 
    I also occasionally stream some other random stuff like Dead Cells, 20XX, puzzle games with my     wife, and I once spent 2 streams breaking “Street cleaning simulator 2011”  </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What got you into gaming? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">As a little boy, my sister and I had an Atari 2600… I had no idea what I was doing, but I was in love with the concept of interacting with my TV.  My aunt had an NES in the Attic of my Grandmother’s house and I played that constantly when I was able to!!! Then my Aunt got an SNES for Christmas the one year and it was all over after that!  </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What was the first game you played? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">  I honestly can’t remember, probably Combat or Asteroids </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What is your all time favorite game? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4"> Final Fantasy VII, the only game I Think I could play over 30 hours (and still counting) without looking at it. </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What do you do for fun off stream? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">  I am a father of 4 (soon to be 5) daughters, and husband to my wonderful wife!!! We watch a lot of movies, and enjoy the outdoors (have a cabin out in the woods that we visit frequently). I love to cook, build things, and also play music in my band/ solo performances. </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">How did you get your Twitch name? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">  My name is actually Joe (I know.. spoilers…)  and I love retro games… and the Nostalgia that     comes with them!!! </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What brought you to the community? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4">A good while back, Noodles messaged me on Reddit and invited me in from r/ Twitch.  After a few weeks of not making much progress as a streamer, I hung it up… took some time to research and learn what it takes to do decent in this community.. Rebranded, and here I am now!  </font></p>
                 <pre>   </pre>
       <p><u><font size="5">What's your favorite thing about Twitch Crew? </font></u></p>
                  <p><font size="4"> The community here is great!!! I remember watching a Twitch Crew Rocket league tournament that was announced by your mods and everything, it was a really fun time!!! 
    It’s always good to be surrounded by cool people and see the support that can flow from these Twitch communities!!!! </font></p>
